POCKET BEAGLE INSTALLATION

LOADING IMAGE:
Using Etcher or Win32DiskImager, make a SSD (16 GB) using this image file:
 https://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.2-iot-armhf-2017-10-10-4gb.img.xz

CONNECT & SHARE
Insert ssd and connect the micro USB to a windows based computer.
The "USB-tether-gadget", allows you to bridge and share the Ethernet Network Devices to acces Internet:
Read the Instruction on how to connect here:
https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/how-to-connect-a-beaglebone-black-to-the-internet-using-usb/cdf66181b3a5436e9ad730e4ed4cf9ee

As described in the above,  you need to create a route sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1
NOTE: On the new image we cannot add  name server to the resolv file,
we need to create a temporary config file:
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8
Remember that you have to add route and recreate /etc/resolv.conf at each reboot.

You can test that the route is working by issuing ping google.com
And get a response like that
PING google.com (172.217.6.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from lga25s54-in-f14.1e100.net (172.217.6.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time= 20.2 ms

A special note about FIREWALLS:  make sure your firewall is configured to  allow  a share connection !!

UPDATING AND LOADING:
sudo apt update
Extend partition: 
sudo /opt/scripts/tools/grow_partition.sh
Upgrade Kernel to RT 4.14:
sudo /opt/scripts/tools/update_kernel.sh --bone-rt-kernel --lts-4_14

Removing some unused packages:
sudo apt remove haveged bonescript c9-core-installer roboticscape bb-node-red-installer --purge

Shutdown apache2 (we dont use it):
sudo systemctl disable apache2

REBOOT AND TEST
sudo reboot
 
Confirm the New kernel:
uname -a
Linux beaglebone 4.14.11-bone-rt-r12 #1 PREEMPT RT Wed Jan 3 23:08:51 UTC 2018 armv7l GNU/Linux

Confirm file system has been extended:
df
Filesystem 		1K-blocks	 Used 		Available 	Use% 
/dev/mmcblk0p1 	15247576 	1739372 	12837360 	12% /

Check SPI correctly mapped (without adding a DTB):
ls /dev/spi*
/dev/spidev0.0 /dev/spidev1.0 /dev/spidev1.1

Check the serial ports as well (dont forget its the letter "O"):
ls /dev/ttyO*
/dev/ttyO0 /dev/ttyO1 /dev/ttyO2 /dev/ttyO4

Check that boot environment include the universal cape (used to map IO):
cat /boot/uEnv.txt
uname_r=4.14.11-bone-rt-r12
enable_uboot_overlays=1
uboot_overlay_pru=/lib/firmware/AM335X-PRU-RPROC-4-4-TI-00A0.dtbo
enable_uboot_cape_universal=1
cmdline=coherent_pool=1M net.ifnames=0 quiet
Note: only the ''active" commands are showned.



WIFI CONNECTION

OPTION A) CONNMAN 
Use it as a client connected to an Access Point.
In that case connman is already loaded and ready to use.
Configuring connman

sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> tether wifi disable
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_*_managed_psk ==> this is your access point
//Your are asked to enter your key//
connmanctl> quit
Once configure the service will be automatically started


OPTION B) HOSTAPD
Use it as an Access Point,  on which you can connect yoy PC or Tablet.
Please note that not all chipsets can act as an Acces Point, take a look in this table on the column AP=Yes: https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers

This require additionnals steps
First disable connman:
sudo systemctl disable connman
Then update tools:
sudo apt-get install hostapd dnsmasq iptables iw wireless-tools


Check the wifi dongle number with 
ifconfig -a
and confirm wlan0 or wlan1 or else

Now edit network files:
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces and add the wifi config (with wlan-number)
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
address 192.168.8.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

Then edit the hostapd.conf file: 
sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=Pocket-Pilot
channel=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
country_code=US
ieee80211d=1
hw_mode=g
macaddr_acl=0
max_num_sta=10
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
rsn_preauth=1
rsn_preauth_interfaces=wlan0
wpa=3
wpa_passphrase=MINIMUM_8_CHARACTERS
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
